# 📚 Bookstore SQL Project

This project is a hands-on SQL database design and query solution based on a bookstore management system. It involves creating tables, inserting and retrieving data, and solving beginner to advanced-level queries.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (but compatible with most SQL engines)
- **Language**: SQL

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Query and their sol.sql`: Full SQL script containing:
  - Table creation (`Books`, `Customer`, `Orders`)
  - SQL queries for various business problems
- `Queries to be solved.sql`: Raw list of SQL problems (basic + advanced)

---

## 📌 Features

- 📘 Retrieve books by genre, year, stock, price, etc.
- 📦 Track orders and calculate total revenue.
- 📊 Advanced analytics like:
  - Most frequently ordered book
  - Total quantity sold by author
  - Customers spending the most
  - Stock remaining after fulfilling orders

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open PostgreSQL** (or any SQL client like DBeaver or pgAdmin).
2. Run the SQL code from `Query and their sol.sql`.
3. Experiment by modifying queries or adding your own!

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT)
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
- Filtering using `WHERE`, `HAVING`
- Grouping & ordering results
- Real-world business use case simulation
